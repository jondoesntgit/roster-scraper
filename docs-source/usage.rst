If you have completed the installation correctly,
your browser should automatically provide a button
just above the vault roster on recognized pages.

To create a printable roster, select whether you
want names in "First Last" format, or in "Last, First"
format. Then, click on the button to create a
printable roster.

If you want to adjust the font-size, there is an
input box at the top of the printable page where
you can enter a font-size.

.. warning::
   avoid large font sizes, as these can cause
   text to overflow the name tag boxes.
