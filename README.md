Andrews University Roster Scraper

More extensive documentation is hosted in sphinx documentation, which
can be accessed online at [github.jamwheeler.com/roster-scraper](//github.jamwheeler.com/roster-scraper).

You should be able to auto-compile the docs with `make html` from the root.
The only thing you need to be aware of is that it does not automatically
include the sample-room-assignments.html page. You'll have to include
that manually.

Sample resident names were generated with an online tool. Any resemblance
to any real persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental.
